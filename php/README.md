# Kata rules

## Iteration 1
Design and implement a software that validates a password applying TDD.

Technical requirements:
We want a method that given a password returns if the password is valid or not.
We don't want to know the reason when the password is invalid (the return value is a boolean)


A valid password should meet the following requirements:

- Have more than 8 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore

## Iteration 2

Design and implement software that can adapt to different password validation rules TDD and focus on the OOP principles.

Let's pretend that now we want to create another type of password validations because on our app we need different type of passwords, such as:


Validation 2:
- Have more than 6 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number

Validation 3:
- Have more than 16 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains an underscore
